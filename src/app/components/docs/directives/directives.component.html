<h1>Directives</h1>
<p><strong>Angular Docs:&nbsp;</strong> <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/directives" target="_blank">Built-in directives</a></p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Use Angular's built-in directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see. <br>
    The different types of Angular directives are as follows:
</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> Used with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.</p>
<p><strong>Attribute directives:</strong> Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.</p>
<p><strong>Structural directives:</strong> Change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>
<p><strong>Angular Docs:&nbsp;</strong> <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/components" target="_blank">Anatomy of a component</a></p>
<p>You should be used to Component directives as they are created with the CLI new component command.</p>
<p><strong>Components are the most common of the three directive types.</strong> A component controls a patch of screen called a view. You define a component's application logic—what it does to support the view—inside a class. The class interacts with the view through an API of properties and methods. </p>
<p>Every component must have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A TypeScript class with behaviors such as handling user input and fetching data from a server</li>
    <li>An HTML template that controls what renders into the DOM</li>
    <li>A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in HTML</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attribute directives</h3>
<p><strong>Angular Docs:&nbsp;</strong> <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/directives/attribute-directives" target="_blank">Attribute directives</a></p>
<p>Attribute directives are used as attributes of elements. They change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.</p>
<p> <strong>ngClass, ngStyle, and ngModel</strong> are examples of attribute directives built-in to the Angular framework.</p>
<p>Dropdowns, accordions, and tabs are just a few common use cases for custom attribute directives. When you have a UI element that will be common throughout your app, you can implement an attribute directive and share it across components and modules to avoid repeating the code for the same functionality.</p>
